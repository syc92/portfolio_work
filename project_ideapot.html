                <p>As there are already a lot of recipe websites out there, the process of looking for a new recipe is sometimes time consuming and frustrating. Ideapot is a social platform for sharing recipes, which helps users find the right recipes that really meet their preference, and helps them successfully prepare a new dish as well.</p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>As an international student who wants to save money and thus usually cook at home instead of dine out, I frequently look for recipes online and want to try a new dish from time to time.</p>
                <p>However, I often find that I can’t try the recipe because I don’t have certain equipment or don’t know where to buy certain ingredients as a newcomer. When I talk to my friends about this, a lot of them are having similar problems. This project aims to solve this problem, making it easier to find and try a right recipe successfully.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h3>Survey</h3>
                <p>In order to find out more needs from the potential users, I first conducted a quick survey among 11 people from different countries. And the following is the most key finding of this survey. It turns out that most people do have similar problems while trying a new recipe.</p>
                <div class="img_item"><img src="image/project_ideapot/ideapot_survey.png" alt="Survey result"></div>

                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <p>I then conducted 3 interviews with some of the potential users. The key finding is that <b>people love to share cooking knowledge with others.</b> This is why I decided to make Ideapot a “social platform”.</p>
                <p>The help from friends can solve part of a user’s cooking problem, but the help from a whole community can make it much easier to successfully try a new recipe. Also, the social media should be based on users’ location, because the availability of certain ingredients and tools varies from place to place.</p>
                <p>In addition, more than one user mentioned that it will be great if Ideapot can provide a <b>step by step tutorial.</b> Most of the recipe websites out there only have a plain text instruction, which is hard to follow.</p>

                <p>After I finished the first version prototype, I conducted some guerilla user testing, and found the following items need improvement most:</p>
                <ul class="project_content_list">
                    <li>In the onboarding preference setup process, more than one users suggested that the expected cooking time should be a range.</li>
                    <li>In the “navigation mode”, some users can’t understand the interface of “steps”. This is also applicable to the steps in sharing/forking a post, because they share the same UI component.</li>
                    <li>While sharing the post, some users suggested that there should be an extra step to confirm or preview the content before sharing it. It feels much “safer”.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <p>The first lesson I learned from this project is that it is important to make sure you’re building something that really meets users’ needs. In the research stage, although the data roughly matched my expectation and assumption, there were some important details that I missed. In the user testing stage, there was also a lot of feedback that I didn’t think of. In conclusion, it is always good to ask what the “real” users are thinking, and build a prototype to test it as early and as fast as possible.</p>
                <h3>If I have more time</h3>
                <p>Since this is a project for a class, I was not able to work on it full-time, so there is a lot of room for improvement.</p>
                <ul class="project_content_list">
                    <li>First, I would like to go into the detail of how people can view the forked recipe, and probably add a price comparing features to it.</li>
                    <li>Second, I would like to conduct more research outside the student group. I imagine this product can be helpful not only for students, but all the people who like or have to cook at home, but are frustrated by the other recipe websites.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thanks for watching! If you have any feedback, or you’re interested in this project, please don’t hesitate to contact me! You can find my contact info in my about page:)</p>
