                            <p class="pRegular">CMX is a SaaS for hiring freelance software developers on-demand. However, the hiring process highly relies on salespeople. As CMX was growing fast, the workload for salespeople became overwhelming. That means it’s hard for the sales team to maintain their conversion rate of turning a lead into a client, and it’s conceivable that the user's experience went bad as well.</p>

                            <p class="pRegular">Our ultimate goal was to automate the hiring process as much as possible. We wanted the dashboard to be self-sufficient so users can complete most steps of the hiring process on their own. Over a few months with several sprints, I redesigned the “request” and “contract page”, and added new features like “team” that releases the sales team’s workload.</p>

                        <p>To hire a developer, clients need to fill out an “onboarding” form, where they can express what kind of developers they need. Based on their response, our sales team will contact them and help them find the best match, and then the sales team will hand hold them to go through a series of tasks such as reviewing shortlists, interviewing candidates, and finally start a contract. As our business grew, all the hand-holding process was making salespeople’s workload overwhelming.</p>

                        <p>We wanted to automate the process as much as possible without changing the process. The time our sales team spent on hand-holding our clients was between after clients completed the onboarding form till they started the contract, and the “hiring dashboard” is where the clients were taken to during which period. So our goal was to look into the old dashboard, and see how we can redesign it to enable automation throughout the hiring process.</p>

                        <p>I conducted some stakeholder (salespeople) interviews, collected feedback from our support team, and observed user behavior through Fullstory to find answers to following questions: how the salespeople and clients interact with the old design, what portion can be automated, and what are the other potential problems.

                        <p>I also investigated how our competitors design their hiring process and corresponding interaction, especially large scale competitors such as Upwork and Toptal. The result showed that most products have a step by step progress bar that clearly shows what step the client is currently taking. They also have a clear layout and navigation for requests and contracts. Through the competitive analysis, I learned that these components would be essential in our new design.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>While designing the new dashboard, I came up with four different mockups based on competitive analysis and the new user journey. I evaluated which one to go with by following criteria:</p>
                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>It has to look good both when the page is empty and when it’s full of content</p></li>
                            <li><p>The hiring process steps has to be clear and easy to interact with</p></li>
                            <li><p>Is it easy to navigate when there are multiple requests and contracts</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="vSpace40"></div>
                        <img class="imageWidthInsideContainer imgBeforeLoaded" onload="preLoadImage(this)" src="image/project_cm_dash/cmx_prototype_opt.jpg" alt="">
                        
                        <div class="vSpace80"></div>

                        <h3 class="pMedium">Layout Exploration II: <br> Display Requests/Contracts on Left Sidebar, and Show Progress Bar and Content on the Right</h3>
                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>Finally I chose layout A to proceed because it uses a progress bar to present the hiring status which matches most people’s mental model of “process”. Also, it uses two columns layout design, and only shows information about a single step in the main area, meaning that it will look good in any case so users only need to focus on the information they need at a time. I then added an additional column for showing the list of hiring requests, which provided better navigation between different requests and contracts.</p>
                        <div class="vSpace40"></div>
                        <img class="imageWidthInsideContainer imgBeforeLoaded" onload="preLoadImage(this)" src="image/project_cm_dash/cmx_prototype_revise.jpg" alt="">

                        <h3 class="pMedium">Content and Status: <br> Display Information in Corresponding Step, and Show Status</h3>
                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>At this stage, I created a prototype to show what information should be displayed, and what status and interaction will there be in each step. In “Request detail”, I show the information that a client provided in the request form, which is not displayed in the old design. In “Consultation”, the content already existed in the old design, so I simply pulled them into the corresponding step and adjusted the layout. The “Shortlist” part also existed in the old design, but here I added status changes to each shortlist, so clients could easily tell what to focus on. Previously, the “Interview” step was completely handled manually by the sales team. Here I put them into the process bar as a final step, and each interview will also have a status, so clients could easily tell what the action items are.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>For the interaction, in the “Shortlist” step, clients can click on the link which will take them to an external page to review the candidate, where they can schedule an interview with them if there is a match (this detail of this design is out of the scale of this project). In the “Interview” step, clients can click on “interview” and the interview link will be open. After interviewing the candidate, they can come back here to “leave a feedback”, which will lead to an external link where they can express whether they want to hire the developer or not.</p>

                        <p>I conduct a few internal usability testing, and according to the feedback I got, I made following iteration for the layout:</p>

                        <ul>

Also, users can’t focus on the main content immediately because this two-columns-menu takes too much space</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Progress bar:</span> users don’t feel like it’s a progress bar because the relationship between each step is not obvious enough</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Main content interaction:</span> the interaction in the shortlist step and the interview step is not intuitive, and users can’t figure out what to do with the UI</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Main content layout:</span> some users are confused by the two different layouts between “Request detail” and the other steps. They don’t feel they are in the same process</p></li>

                            <p>To allow clients to start the page on their own, there are two things clients have to do on the contract page: sign the contract and initiate the protocol of collaboration. We considered two types of design, making it mandatory for the client to complete both of them to start the project, or simply make it a reminder which they do not need to complete before starting the projects. We finally decided to go with the “Reminder” because we reckoned that making it mandatory might be too pushy.</p>

                            <p>Although usually our salespeople would help the client set up their payment method in the early stages of the hiring process, there would be some cases where they don’t from time to time (e.g. they wanted to speed up the process for certain clients). However, making sure clients have a payment method in our system was crucial for us to make sure we will receive the payment. So I designed a page to handle this type of case. Clients have to add a payment method before they can see anything in the dashboard.</p>

                        <p class="contentBlockWidth_8_12">There’s not much design in this but just a decision. I originally planned to design a lightweight chat room in the new dashboard, but it turned out to be too much effort for the dev team. At the same time, we realized that our sales team used Intercom in our other products. In addition, Intercom can be integrated with Slack, by which salespeople can reply to the message more in time. Therefore, we decided to use it for communicating with clients in the dashboard.</p>

                        <p>Making the design spec that is easy for developers to read is always the best practice at the end of a project. At Codementor, I will always create an interaction/layout instruction like this for developers, uploading them to Zeplin along with the design of each screen. In addition, I will also write up a comprehensive spec in a Github issue.</p>

                        <p>After we launched the new design, along with several iterations, improving and adding more relevant features, our clients and revenue grew nearly 2 times in around 1 year. It is definitely not only because of the new design. It definitely is the team effort that made this happen. But I’m glad that the new design can help the team achieve such accomplishments.</p>

                        <p>First of all, this redesign was only the beginning. Plenty of features are not designed perfectly. For example, the “reschedule” and the “shortlist” page should probably be combined into the main dashboard. In addition, as we learn more from the users (clients), and as our sales strategy changes, there will be more iteration and improvement.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>This project pretty much summarizes what I learned in my entire time working at Codementor. The biggest takeaways from my journey at Codementor is that I learned how to collaborate with PM, developers, and other team members, working together to make the product and the company better. As a designer, I do not only think from design and users’ perspective, but I also learn how to think from a business perspective. And equally if not more importantly, learning other roles’ language is also a key to success. You can only work together and roll out products smoothly when every role can put themselves in others’ shoes. </p>
