                <p>During my time working as a product designer at Codementor, the company has two major products: Codementor and CodementorX. Codementor is the software engineering mentorship platform, while CodementorX is a freelance platform for software engineers. Other than that, we also rolled out some side projects or sub products from time to time. Each of these products is handled by different designers. Therefore, this project aims to create a guideline to designer to follow, trying to maintain the consistency across products in sake of branding, but still allowing designers to create the unique design for each product based on this guideline.</p>
                <p>(Sadly, CodementorX is now rebranded as <a href="https://arc.dev/">Arc.dev</a>, so you can’t see my work in production:( But go check their new look and branding. It’s awesome!) </p>

                <p>At the design stage, I spent most of my time testing out different layouts, and tried out different styles of illustration. Other than the landing page itself, I also created some sub pages that are related to it, including SEO pages, FAQ pages, and testimonial pages.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Although a landing page is usually not the core of a product, it is important because it makes a first impression to potential users and affects how they see the product. After we rolled out this landing page, the design was shared on a design inspiration site called Landbook, which is a small win for my team and myself. I would definitely say that this website and the branding are not perfect, because the lifecycle of a brand in the tech industry is short that you have to constantly update and improve your product, even for branding as well! IIn the traditional way, however, branding is a very long process. You have to use different methods to communicate with users, build the image of the brand, and test out different strategies. Therefore, the most interesting part, and also the hardest, of rebranding a digital product is how to find the balance between fast and efficiency.</p>
