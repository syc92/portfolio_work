            </section>
            <section class="gallery">
                <p>During my time working as a product designer at Codementor, the company has two major products: Codementor and CodementorX. Codementor is the software engineering mentorship platform, while CodementorX is a freelance platform for software engineers. Other than that, we also rolled out some side projects or sub products from time to time. Each of these products is handled by different designers. Therefore, this project aims to create a guideline to designer to follow, trying to maintain the consistency across products in sake of branding, but still allowing designers to create the unique design for each product based on this guideline.</p>
                <p>(Sadly, CodementorX is now rebranded as <a href="https://arc.dev/">Arc.dev</a>, so you can’t see my work in production:( But go check their new look and branding. It’s awesome!) </p>

                <h2>Start from the basics</h2>
                <p>We start from unifying our color palette and font choice. For the color palette, each product has its own unique color theme for branding, but all of them share the same color theme for common elements. Therefore, our main color theme comprises both the branding color theme and the common color theme. For the typeface, we choose Raleway for title and open sans for body text. </p>

                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>Afterwards, we outline the principles for designing our shared design element and guideline, including dimension, element size, round corner, and element status. The goal of this stage is to minimize the options so we can have a more consistent interface across platforms, but allow designers to be able to have enough options to accommodate different situations. In case you’re interested why we’re using the 4px grid system, <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632">[this article by Elliot Dahl]</a> well explained our reasoning.</p>

                <h2>Use case analysis</h2>
                <p>While we continue to build our shared design elements, we found the behavior of some elements are also inconsistent across platforms. Therefore we also look into and unify the use cases and the behavior of certain elements. Here’s one example I’ve done. We have a component called “tag picker”, which behaves differently across platforms. I make this chart to analyze its behavior, and discuss with my team about what is the best way to unify its behavior.</p>

We also upload the final outcome to Zeplin, and document our result in Notion, so both design team and development team can refer to them if needed.</p>

                <p>After we created our guideline, how can it really help the design team to work more efficiently? One of our senior product designers, Vita, comes up with a brilliant way to do that. Our team uses Sketch as our main tool, and its powerful “nested symbol” feature allows us to select all the components from the menu with different status and colors.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <p>Creating a design guideline is a continuing process. As we were creating this guideline, we kept finding that there were some edge cases that we didn’t consider. Sometimes there were also new demands emerging as our products grew. So we have to revisit the principles we outlined at the very beginning and make adjustments to them. Also, the guideline also needs iteration from time to time, so we can make sure the look of our products is always refreshing, and our users have consistent experience all the time.</p>
                <h3>What could have be done better</h3>
                <p>One thing I think we could have done better is accessibility. When we outlined our principles and guidelines, we did not consider the accessibility thoroughly. In fact, some of our colors might pass the web accessibility test. It didn’t cause any negative effect to our product performance immediately, but it definitely should be included into our consideration and become a part of the guideline.</p>
