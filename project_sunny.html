At this stage, the research goal is simply to learn how the participants experience depression, and what problems they encounter during a depression episode. The key findings are:</p>

                        <p>It was conceivable that this app was going to help people cope with depression, or simply help them relax in some ways, so I also asked interviewees about this, and collected various kinds of coping methods that people use to cope with depression. The common ones include: exercise, pick up a hobby, or simply take care of themselves. This was particularly helpful for me while brainstorming ideas.</p>

                        <p>In my original plan, I intended to design for all young adults (age of 18 to 35) who have depression. However, after the first round of interviews, I realized that everyone’s condition is different. I need to refine the persona so that I can determine whom this product is designed for. The target audience should also be those who:</p>

                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>The reason I narrow down to this population is because people who experience or try to deal with depression for the first time is the most vulnerable and helpless, and I only focus on minor to intermediate level of depression because if it’s a extremely severe depression, they probably should have more thorough treatment (or they are already having the treatment), and a simple app probably couldn’t do anything in that situation. </p>

                        <p>Based on the needs finding results, I came up with three concepts that address different problems that people with depression have.

                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Concept I:</span> Users have a neutral attitude toward concept 1, mainly because the technology (chat bot) seems not feasible, and although the analysis component can help them learn their mental health issues, it doesn’t necessarily make them feel better. However, they did indicate that the system can provide some sort of “emotional support.” One participant mentioned that they watch videos that say nice things to them that will make them feel calm and relaxed. Another participant mentioned that instead of an AI chatbot for counselling, they preferred this AI to guide them to do something relaxing. These two feedback gave me crucial information for the next few rounds of iteration.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Concept II:</span> This one is helpful in terms of letting users know they are not alone and support each other in the community, but users are worried that the forum will be full of negative emotion, and lots of people with depression don’t like to listen to the negative thoughts about depression from others. </p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Concept III:</span> This one is most desirable and helpful. It’s an important piece that should always be available in the app, because it’s a necessary intervention when users need professional help.</p></li>

                        <p>Regarding the “emotional support” element, some participants mentioned that they sometimes watch videos that say nice things to them that will make them feel calm and relaxed. Instead of building an AI powered chatbot, I decided to design a positive quote generator and activity suggestions/reminder system to provide emotional support.</p>

                        <p>Again, I ran a quick testing with two participants. Participants liked the aspect of activity suggestion and reminder, but they found that the positive quotes piece was less helpful. For the activity feature, participants also think it will be great if they can have more freedom of choosing and planning the activity. In conclusion, I will need another pivot for feature 1. Eventually, I only kept the “activity” component (and renamed it as “Eggtivity”, a wordplay that related to the app name. I will explain why below), which provides more freedom for users to choose and plan their activities. Users can click on the egg icon, “crack” an Eggtivity, set a goal, and start it.</p>

                        <p>Since almost all the users mentioned that they probably wouldn’t want to see any negative content regarding depression in this forum, I decided to make this forum only about sharing positive stories, suggestions on what activities to do, or what tools/apps they use to cope with depression.</p>

                        <p>Although there were no major usability issues found in the testing, I simplified the content types. In the previous design, there were “posts” and “apps” suggestions. However, I figured that the “sharing apps” feature could be a little confusing for the users, and the interaction behind it could be too complicated. So I only kept the post format. On the other hand, I added a “content moderation system” and “content from influencer” based on participants feedback:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Content moderation system:</span> For the mcommunity (forum) feature and the review system of finding a therapist, the design should think through how to moderate the content.</p></li>
                            <li><p><span class="pMedium">Content from influencer:</span> Participants thought it can also consider pulling the content generated by influencers and thought leaders in the fields. So in the final design, there are two type of “post” – post from community members, and content crawled/collected from influencers or major health content website (added by the system).</p></li>

                        <p>As mentioned in the ideation section, the key component of this feature is that users can fill out a form, and then the system will find the therapists that are the best fit for them based on their responses. It will also show a “matching score” and a “checklist” so the users can easily identify the best fit or even compare different options. On therapists’ profile page, there will be photos of the clinic environment, and video of the therapists speaking, which were considered crucial in the previous interviews and testings. Finally, there will be a review system that users can provide constructive feedback about how a therapist is (or not) helpful.</p>

                        <p>First, I refined the previous wireframe and added more detailed interaction for this feature, and I also created the design for the regular therapist page (access through the bottom navbar), where the therapist profile won’t have a match score.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace40"></div>
                        <p>For the review system, originally planned to ask users to provide pros and cons about a therapist. However, this format might not be able to elicit the most helpful information from a patient. I changed the format to asking users to leave a comment toward a certain aspect of the service/treatment they received. During the user testing, there were no major issues found. However, same as Concept II, participants also mentioned that they are worried about if someone would abuse the review system. Therefore, I added a report mechanism, allowing users to report inappropriate comments or assaultation.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>One major differentiator of this app is the “positive” environment. Therefore, I called this app Sunny Side, which implies the sense of joyfulness and positivity. On top of that, I named Concept I’s activity as “Eggitivity”, which is a wordplay that extends the concept of Sunny Side Up (the way of cooking eggs) and reinforces the branding.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>In the final prototype, I only created the prototype for the “eating” activity. However, the interaction and content of each activity would be different. I should continue working on the design and testing for each activity.</p>

                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>For feature 2, the interaction design is almost complete, but how the design of sharing coping skills and positive stories/experiences could be improved along the way. In addition, perhaps the aspect of “sharing coping skills” can be integrated with the “Eggtivity” feature, i.e. community members can share how they plan their activities.</p>

                        <h3 class="pMedium">Feature III: <br> There Should Be More Guidance while Filling Out the Form</h3>
                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>For feature 3, the interaction design is also complete, but there are more details that can be added to the flow. For example, in the Quick Match form, the step of choosing a therapy method can be a daunting task for those who don’t have relevant knowledge. In the profile page, there should be more detailed information about the therapist. A reference for that is the profile page on Psychology Today (PT). However, I should keep in mind that balancing the amount of information is critical because in the previous interviews, multiple participants mentioned that PT’s profile page has too much information. Last but not least, the review system will probably need a few more iterations. I should run more testing on which way is the most effective and ethical.</p>

                        <p>I am happy that I spent lots of time talking with participants in order to find their needs and define the problem space. However, I should’ve done it more efficiently. I would say that my final prototype and solution are in the right direction, but I haven’t done enough testing and interaction in the design process.</p>

                        <h3 class="pMedium">Should Focus on One Feature</h3>
                        <div class="vSpace28"></div>
                        <p>As some of the classmates suggested, I should focus on one single feature for this app. I do think that combining the three features I have is definitely good for both the app and the users, but given the time limitation, and also due to the delay in the early stage, I couldn’t combine them together very well and integrate them as a one single elegant solution. If I focus on only one feature, I could have more time to validate the idea and refine the detailed interaction.</p>
