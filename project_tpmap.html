                <p>Have you ever been to Taipei City? Imagine you’re traveling in Taipei for the first time and you don’t speak the language and don’t know its culture, planning where to go and what to do is a little bit daunting, isn’t it? In order to help tourists like you to explore Taipei more easily, I collaborated with a tourism start-up, Like It Formosa, to create this Taipei Map. You can get this map either in some hostels or from the Like It Formosa team. Can’t get the map? At least you can see how it was made:P</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>No matter how useful a piece of information is, it can only be easily digested by the audience with appealing appearance and clear structure. Therefore, the Like It Formosa team and I decided to blend those dry information into the scenery of Taipei City. There are two sides of this map. The front side is general tourist information, the back side is recommendation. The following sketches are how I construct the layout for the information. First, we made a basic layout to determine what sections to put on the map. Second, we went through what information we had and discussed what’s the best way to display them. Third, I made some basic layout for detail content; and adjusted the layout with folding lines. Finally, I dive into the sketches for final illustration.</p>

                <h2>Color</h2>
                <p>Before we go to the illustration, let’s take a look at the color schemes. I used green as the primary color because based on my discussion with Like It Formosa Team, we think that green is the color that can represent Taipei, or Taiwan, most. Thus the primary color of the illustration are green with different shades, and it’s used mainly for the background (street scenery). The secondary colors are some warm colors such as yellow and orange, which are used for characters and building.</p>

                <h2>Illustration</h2>
                <p>The first image in this section (see below) is the result of applying the color schemes to the illustration. I didn’t add too many details to the illustration because I didn’t want it to affect the readability. I used the road in the city to guide users attention, and blended the information into corresponding part of Taipei City, so users can easily discover them. Regarding the illustration for the items in the city scenery, I iterated them and made their style consistent throughout the entire map, such as the food below (I hope you’re not too hungry right now). Regarding readability, I also remade the Taipei MRT map so it can fit in the map but still with good readability.</p>

                <h2>Size</h2>
                <p>Considering that our users might carry this map everywhere and check the information quite often, the map’s unfolded size is 560*378mm, with which is large enough to contain the copious information, but its folded size is only 80*126mm, which users can easily fit the map in their pocket.</p>

                <h2>Final design</h2>
                <p>From constructing the information structure to final layout, and from the design strategy to design/illustration detail, the biggest challenge in this project was how can I fit those complex information into a not very large piece of paper, make it appealing and fun, and still maintain the readability. Well, it really took me a lot of time iterating it. I basically repeated all the steps above for 3 months to figure out the best way to display these information. But the Like It Formosa team and I managed to pull this off. Here is the final design of Taipei Map. Enjoy!</p>
