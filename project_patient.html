                <h2>Interviews &amp; affinity wall</h2>
                <p>The overarching goals of the interviews are, first, how does the appointment process actually look like, and second, how the staff collaborate with each other during the process. We conducted the interviews with six interviewees, including two providers, one medical assistant, one front-desk receptionist, and two patients. For each role, we come up with one overarching question, 10 to 15 main questions, and 3 to 5 possible follow up questions for each main question. The interview questions can be roughly categorized into the following groups:</p>
                <ul class="project_content_list">
                    <li>The experience of each role interacting with patients</li>
                    <li>How does staff interact with other, i.e. communication, collaboration</li>
                    <li>How do they (both patient and staff) access W’s resources, e.g. patient portal (EMR), social media, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We transformed the interview results into affinity notes and clustered them on the affinity wall.</p>

            <section class="gallery" id="findings">
                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <h3>Primary – Language barriers</h3>
                <p>According to our interview results, we learned that a significant percentage of W’s patients lack English proficiency, and most of them speak Bengali and Arabic. However, through the artifact analysis, we found that the majority of patient resources, including patient portal, printed health education materials, and their social media content, are only available in English. This stops their patients from utilizing these resources.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, language barriers also exist in verbal communication between W and their patients. In order to tackle the verbal communication barriers, W hires medical assistants and front desk receptionists who speak Bengali and Arabic, and utilizes the “language line (translation line)” during patients’ visits. However, there are some issues:</p>
                <ul class="project_content_list">
                    <li>Translators do not possess adequate medical knowledge and/or medical terms
                        <ul class="project_content_list">
                            <li>The front desk lacks training on understanding medical terminology. Several interviewees, even the front desks themselves, indicated that there must be some mistakes during their translation</li>
                            <li>The medical assistants have medical background, but they don’t necessarily know the medical term in their native language which might also cause misunderstanding during the translation</li>
                            <li>Family members come along with the patients also frequently play the role of translator. However, most of them lack professional medical training which also cause misunderstanding during translation</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Different dialects
                        <ul class="project_content_list">
                            <li>Even though translation line and bilingual staff is employed, different dialects also contributes to the language barriers. One example is that, there was one time the interpreters on the translation line did not understand the dialect spoken by the patients and they just hung up on the patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The negative impacts caused by language barriers are:</p>
                <ul class="project_content_list">
                    <li>First, as the translators are not professional trained, the translation is sometimes inaccurate. The inaccuracy will potentially reduce the health care outcome</li>
                    <li>Second, the translation/interpretation is time consuming. It usually takes 10 mins to get an interpreter on the phone, which is a significant amount of time given that the appointments are 30 mins on average. This is a reason that contributes to the appointment delay which, according to some interviewees, is a bad experience for both W’ staff and patients</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="img_item"><img src="image/project_patient/patient_findings_p.jpg" alt="Primary findings"></div>
                <h3>Secondary – Understaffed and poor job function support</h3>
                <p>Besides language barriers, no sufficient medical staff to meet patients need, and poor job function support also causes negative impacts to W’s services.</p>
                <ul class="project_content_list">
                    <li>Over the past few months, while the amount of patients increases, the number of W’s medical assistant reduces from 5 to 4</li>
                    <li>For the medical assistant and the front desk, although translation is one of their responsibilities, it still stops them from doing their primary job which potentially makes them constantly pressed for time</li>
                    <li>W only has one patient care coordinator who is responsible for all the affairs regarding insurance, referral, and overall communication with patients. Therefore, the patient care coordinator relies on the front desk and medical assistants to help with her duties</li>
                    <li>Walk patients to the front desk for check out is medical assistant’s duty. However, they do not always do that. Two potential reasons are, first, inconsistent understanding of responsibilities, or second, as mentioned above, they just don’t have enough time to complete all their work while supporting patient care coordinator and translation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Experiencing understaffed and unclear duty means that the medical staff is not always able to complete their tasks which causes negative impacts on patients’ health care outcome. For example, the checkout process is where the patients will learn about patient portal, which can really help patients elevate their health outcome and experience, but since the medical assistants do not always walk patients to the front desk for checkout, many patients do not even know that there is a patient portal that they can utilize.</p>

                <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <h3>Improve translation and interpretation quality</h3>
                <p>For the issues of our primary finding, language barriers, our primary suggestion is to translate education materials, social media content, and patient portal into Bengali and Arabic; and collaborate with professional interpreters to improve their interpretation services. However, given that W doesn’t have the budget to hire professional interpreters/translators, the cost-efficient solutions would be: 1) collaborate with professional medical interpreters from Michigan Medicine which provides interpretation service in over 70 languages including Arabic and Bengali (Figure 1), 2) encourage and support the bilingual staff to take courses to improve their professional interpretation skills (Figure 2), 3) work with medical students who specialize in a certain language, or 4) recruit patients who have a prior medical background. The idea here is to reach out to people in the neighborhood and university students who are willing to contribute their specialty in medicine and translation to the health community and/or gain hands-on experiences.</p>
                <div class="img_item"><img src="image/project_patient/patient_r_1.png" alt="Recommendations 1"></div>
                <div class="img_item"><img src="image/project_patient/patient_r_2.png" alt="Recommendations 2"></div>
                <h3>Clarify responsibility</h3>
                <p>As mentioned above, medical assistants don’t routinely walk patients to the front desk for checking out, and the patient care coordinator is potentially overburdened with responsibilities and thus frequently ask for help from medical assistants and front desk receptionists. Although hiring extra staff will be the easiest solution, it is not practical because of W’s limited budget. Therefore, our suggestions for W is to standardize the workflow and inform every staff to follow this standard. It would improve the patients’ experiences and save both staff and patients’ time.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The mission of W is to promote community wellness through providing healthcare services with positive patient outcomes; on the other hand, W wants to make sure that their services can meet the needs of low income and low-literacy the population of immigrants. The interviews conducted in W indicated that the biggest challenges faced by W is language barriers, which causes negative impacts on health care outcomes and patients’ experience. As such, our recommendations prioritize improving upon information accessibility that can ameliorate the language barriers and potentially optimize the entire appointment process.</p>
